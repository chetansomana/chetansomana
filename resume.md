</p>
<p>
    &gt; Creating Documentation in confluence  to explaining the flow of
    creating coverage for the register model.
</p>
<p>
    &gt; Maintaining the main branch of GIT  version control while team lead is
    away. Able to deliver successful release tag  to design verification team
    and as well as AMS team.

    <strong><u>16*16 router using UVM</u></strong> <strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Checking the same functionality mentioned  below with UVM. Learned using
    factory, we can create UVM components like  driver, monitor, agent,
    environment. Checked if the components are registered  by printing the
    hierarchy. Passed the values from different scope through  UVM_CONFIG. Made
    the connection to the DUT using virtual interface.
</p>
<p>
    Tools used: VCS, Verdi
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>16*16 router using SV</u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Built a testbench for 16*16 router which  sends a packet from input port to
    output port. All the information about the  port address and data is
    encapsulated in a packet class and is randomized.  Driver is used to drive
    the packet object to DUT and a monitor is used to  sample and is given to
    scoreboard to verify. Accomplished 100% functional  coverage. Learned SV
    constructs real time use case.

<p>
    <strong>Bachelor  of Engineering</strong>/ CGPA  7.29
</p>
<p>
    <u>Methodist  College of Engineering and Technology</u>
</p>
<p>
    I have invested 4 years of my  engineering in coding and electronics. I was
    fascinated by the LEDs which glow  on billboards, so, I made 4*4*4 LED cube.
    LEDs are controlled by Arduino uno.  By this I can dump program which turn
    the cube into different patterns. I am  also an intermediate programmer in
    Java, Python. Using OpenCV library, I have  built a motion tracker which
    replicates hand movement on paint.

<p>
    <u>Mac Arthur  High School</u>
</p>
<p>
    During my High School, I made  new friends from distinct cultures as USA is
    highly diverse. This helped me to  have more interactions with people having
    different perspectives.

    <u>Bhashyam  High School</u>
</p>
<p>
    I have developed various  interests during my school days. Geography,
    Finance, Biology, Math <a name="_Int_tB5bHJQB">are</a> few of them. These
    interests helped me to be a  participant in every conversation people have.

    &gt; <strong>Cadence RTL to GDS II Flow v5.0:  (completed)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During the course I’ve learned the other end  spectrum of the verification.
    We started with a simple 8 bit sequential  counter. Done RTL simulation,
    coverage analysis, logic synthesis, floor  planning, power planning,
    placement, cts, routing, sta, gls, gdsII.
</p>
<p>
    Got  familiarized with Genus, Lec, Innovus, tempus tools.
</p>
<p>
    &gt; <strong>Cadence  Jasper formal-fundamentals-v2212 (ongoing)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During the  course I’ve developed mindset to avoid assertion liveness.
    Instead use  auxiliary code and split into multiple properties
